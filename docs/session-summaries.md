# Session Summary - Domain Migration & Buyer Profile Fix

## 🎯 What We Accomplished Today:

### 1. **Domain Strategy Evolution**
- ✅ Started with InvestiScope.net (current domain)
- ✅ Explored ApuLink.com as potential rebrand
- ✅ Researched multiple Italian property-focused domains
- ✅ Discovered investinpuglia.it/.com were already taken
- ✅ **Successfully registered investinpuglia.eu** - recognizing .eu as strategic advantage for EU grants
- ✅ Began DNS configuration in GoDaddy (encountered www CNAME conflict)

### 2. **Navigation Cleanup**
- ✅ Identified need to remove "Surveys" and "Fiscal Code" from navbar
- ✅ Created updated Navbar component without these items
- ✅ Kept "Buyer Profile" in Tools dropdown menu

### 3. **Buyer Profile Debugging**
- ✅ Identified the issue: Step 2+ showing blank pages
- ✅ Diagnosed root cause: missing render methods for sections 2-10
- ✅ Created complete replacement with all 10 sections properly implemented
- ⚠️ **Still needs to be deployed** - current live version only has Step 1 working

### 4. **Brand Positioning**
- ✅ Developed "Invest in Puglia" as new brand identity
- ✅ Created positioning: "EU Property Grants & Investment"
- ✅ Prepared comprehensive migration documentation

## 🔴 Critical Issues to Fix:

1. **Buyer Profile is BROKEN** - Only Step 1 works, Steps 2-10 are blank
